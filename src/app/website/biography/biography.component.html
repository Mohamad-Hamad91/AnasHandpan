                            There's an old saying, 'That what doesn't kill you, makes you stronger' I don't believe

                <p>Emi Haze graduated from the Institute
                    of Design in Verona with
                    a degree in Graphic Design
                    and Advertising Design.I live in the north-east of Italy and my huge passion is digital art.
                    Art and painting connected to technology have always been my strongest passions. People think I am
                    calm, quiet, sometimes introvert, really creative, inspired and perfectionist.
                    In my opinion everything in every moment has an artistic side, the aesthetics of things, people
                    around me...
                    for me everything has its own importance, images, textures, sounds, fragrances, my creativity is
                    costantly stimulated.</p>
                <p>I currently work as freelance and in the last years I focused on personal projects and creations in
                    order to build,
                    my own wide portfolio that could distinguish me both in style, technique and creativity.
                    In my first works i focused on a graphic style based on construction and deconstruction of the human
                    body
                    using various tools and graphic effects that render it almost a sketch.</p>
                <p>In my recent works I tried to merge the human body with nature or rather with the four elements of
                    fire,
                    air, water and earth, and even with a fifth esoteric element: the Aristotelian ether, that includes
                    all the others,
                    the essence of celestial bodies, eternal and unchangeable in comparison with the earth as a place of
                    change.
                    The result is the vision of my imaginative world hanging between reality and fantasy, dream and
                    utopia
                    and in which color and sensitivity have the predominant role.</p>

                <p>Photoshop is the software I prefer to conceive my works, in which I also include the digital version
                    of hand-made elements,
                    such as scratches and ink marks, acrylic or watercolor stains. The outcome is technically always
                    appealing and intriguing.
                    Music is the key of this creative process. I could mention Sigur Rós, Radiohead, Bloc Party,
                    Coldplay, Bjork etc.
                    I’m also fond of movies, I love every kind cinema, especially indie movies and art movies.</p>
